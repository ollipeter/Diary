        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Oliver, and I am currently a student learning web development and Java programming.</p>

        <p>I enjoy building websites and exploring how things work behind the scenes. Iâ€™m excited to be part of this course and to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>Outside of coding, I like reading, biking, and learning about new cultures and languages.</p>

        <p>This diary project is part of my learning journey where I reflect on what I learn during each teaching block.</p>
